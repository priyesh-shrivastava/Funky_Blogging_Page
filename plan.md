### Comprehensive Plan for Executing the Task

#### Information Gathered:
- The `app.py` file contains the main Flask application logic, including routes for creating, editing, and deleting blog posts.
- The `new_post.html` template provides a user-friendly form for creating new posts, styled with Bootstrap and animations.

#### Plan:
1. **Enhance the `new_post` route in `app.py`:**
   - Add validation to ensure that the title and content fields are not empty before creating a new post.
   - Implement error handling to provide user feedback if the post creation fails.

2. **Update the `new_post.html` template:**
   - Add a success message that displays after a post is successfully created.
   - Include error messages to inform users if there are issues with their submission.

#### Dependent Files to be Edited:
- `app.py`: To enhance the logic for creating new posts.
- `new_post.html`: To improve user feedback and form validation.

#### Follow-up Steps:
- Verify the changes in the application.
- Test the post creation functionality to ensure it works as expected.
